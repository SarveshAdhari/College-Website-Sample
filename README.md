# College-Website-Sample

# 17-11-2021

# This is a sample of  a college website. Only a few pages have been made since the focus was kept on components like login, logout and registering forms.

# The backend has been done in Python(Flask).
# Basic HTML and CSS have been used for frontend. No fancy frontend content here. Bootstrap has been used for the templates like navbar and buttons.
